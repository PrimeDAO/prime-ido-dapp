To host a Launch via Prime Launch, you will need to follow the application process. Please follow the below steps to apply or request support from a Prime Launch Representative by filling out <a href="https://kolektivo.typeform.com/to/TPMzQKFE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this form</a>.

## Application Process

1. Go to the <a href="/register">application page</a> to get started. 
2. Choose Seed or Liquid launch, then follow the steps in the registration process and fill in all relevant data. When in doubt, don't hesitate to reach out to a Prime Launch Representative through the <a href="https://kolektivo.typeform.com/to/TPMzQKFE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">help form</a>. After filling in and checking your submission data, submit your application.

Your application is now submitted to Prime Launch and the evaluation process will start shortly. It takes 5-10 days for a project to be reviewed. You will be contacted as soon as the process has finalized. 

## Evaluation Process

Official Prime Launches are curated by PrimeDAO to ensure all listed projects are on par with Prime Launch's standards. After submitting the application form, the Prime DAO-appointed Prime Launch multi-sig will take up to 5 days to approve or deny the submission.

If the launch is approved, it will become visible in the Prime Launch UI, and you will be ready to continue the launch process, as described in the next section. 

If your application is not accepted, consider opening a <a href="https://daotalk.org/c/primedao/38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prime Forum</a> thread to receive feedback on your application and potentially resubmit your application after incorporating feedback.

## Launch Process

Once your launch is approved, you will need to finish setting it up using the <a href= "https://admin.launch.prime.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admin dashboard</a>. On the dashboard, depending on the stage of your launch, you will see buttons to:

- Send the required project tokens to the launch contract
- Set up a whitelist for contributors (if applicable for your launch)
- Pause the launch
- Close the launch
- Reclaim any extra project tokens (once the launch is over)

These buttons will only work for the admin address you chose for your launch.

## Post Launch

Once a launch is complete, the project admin may reclaim any unused project tokens from the <a href= "https://admin.launch.prime.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admin dashboard</a>.
