          <li>Save to IPFS the Seed registration information you just entered</li>
          <li>Create a transaction for a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet that PrimeDAO will use to approve and execute the creation of the seed</li>
          <li>Give you a URL pointing to IPFS that you can use to review the saved Seed information</li>
          <li>Upon multisig approval, the new Seed will be created and automatically appear here in Prime Launch</li>
          <li>To enable the Seed to become usable, someone must transfer
