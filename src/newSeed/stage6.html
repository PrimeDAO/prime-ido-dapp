        After you click the SUBMIT button we're going to:
        <ol>
          <li>Save to IPFS the Seed registration information you just entered</li>
          <li>Create a transaction for a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet that PrimeDAO will use to approve and execute the creation of the seed</li>
          <li>Give you a URL pointing to IPFS that you can use to review the saved Seed information</li>
          <li>Upon multisig approval, the new Seed will be created and automatically appear here in Prime Launch</li>
          <li>To enable the Seed to become usable, you will need to transfer the required seed token funds to the contract address.
            The required seed token funds include the amount to be disbursed plus the amount to be paid in fees
            to the beneficiary
